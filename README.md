# Virtual-Assistant
This is a basic virtual assistant

## Features

- Reads back the text data using GTTS module
- Reads date and time
- Reads the bio of a person from Wikipedia module
- Randomly generates greeting responses

## Working
Clone the repository and execute the python script. The User Experience is still a little buggy, but it is fixable with simple changes to the script.

## Todo
- Building a web interface.
- Adding more functional tokens to the assistant
- Threading the program to work in an efficient way
